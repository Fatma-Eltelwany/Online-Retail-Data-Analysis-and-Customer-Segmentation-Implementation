# Online-Retail-Data-Analysis-and-Customer-Segmentation-Implementation
Online Retail data is analyzed to know which place would be the best to open a physical store. Customers are assessed and classified into groups according their most recent purchase, the frequency they buy with, and the money they spent on our products. All code is in SQL, I am using Postgree SQL here.
